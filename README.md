# Course Hive Academy

Course Hive Academy is a portfolio-ready, responsive landing site for an online learning platform. It demonstrates modern frontend best practices, a clean UI built with Tailwind CSS, and a small set of reusable components.

Key goals for this repository:
- Showcase a professional landing page and course browsing experience suitable for portfolios.
- Demonstrate component-driven design, accessibility improvements, and performance awareness.

Tech stack
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn-style UI primitives
- React Router for routing
- TanStack Query (client-side data patterns)

Getting started (local)
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd course-hive-academy
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

What I changed (portfolio polish)
- Project metadata and SEO-friendly meta tags.
- Rebranded site copy to "Course Hive Academy" and improved hero/footer copy.
- Replaced Lovable-specific content with clear developer instructions and project description.

Recommended next steps to finish portfolio polish
- Improve mobile navigation and add keyboard-accessible skip links.
- Add at least two real pages: Course detail and Category listing with seeded content.
- Add testimonials, a CTA section, and an about/creator section describing the project goals.
- Add linting, basic unit or visual tests, and a CI workflow for builds.

If you'd like, I can proceed to implement the items above (mobile nav, accessibility, course detail page, and CI). Reply with which items you want prioritized and I'll start applying them directly to the repo.

Small note: This repository was initially scaffolded with an automated tool; I've started cleaning and polishing it to be portfolio-ready.
